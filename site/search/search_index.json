This website is the home of the ClearGauntlets project, a fork of the LucidVR project focusing on refining the \"reel\" design of Prototype 4.1 to create a sleeker, more effective virtual reality glove. The main gimmick of this project is \"premium\" design. The price ceiling per pair is raised from $60 to $200, but for that, we hope to give you simpler, smaller, more reliable reels, a better PCB and wiring harness, and SteamVR tracking! Please bear with us as we build all this, it's really complicated. This website also hopes to become a resource for anyone looking to get into VR hacking, a starting place for learning the basic components of a VR system, a host for detailed descriptions, source code, schematics, and guides. Ideally, you will be able to go from zero to full pair of custom gloves just by clicking through this website.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-clearwiki","text":"This website is the home of the ClearGauntlets project, a fork of the LucidVR project focusing on refining the \"reel\" design of Prototype 4.1 to create a sleeker, more effective virtual reality glove.

Motivation : We are using a thirdd party joystick such as here . Since the flex cable is very short and flimsy, we want to create a small PCB board to hold, and connect pins to the main PCB more reliably. Components Joystick This joystick is the 3rd party replacement for the joycon. Schematics The measurement of the joystick in mm: Adaptor We need a 5-pin (0.5mm spaced) adaptor to connect on the board and split the pins to the standard dupont spacing (2.56 mm). This model can be found on Mouser. PCB 3D model Assembly The joystick will be mounted on the backside of the PCB either by through holes or hot glued it directly. Then, the flex cable will connect to the adaptor. A horizontal 5-pin male dupont will be place at the J2 and run a wire to the main PCB. The idea is to make PCB-joystick as a module which will be placed on the side of the index finger.","title":"ClearGauntlet - Joystick PCB"},{"location":"joystick-PCB/#cleargauntlet-joystick-pcb","text":"Joystick PCB - Schematics Design for interfacing between Joycon's joystick and main PCB.

Specs The board has the following I/O: 1 ESP 32 V1 10 potentiometers, each requires 1 3.3V pin, 1 GND, 1 Analog pin. 5 servo motors, each requires 1 5V pin, 1 GND, 1 Analog pin. 2 pushed bottons 1 joystick (5 pins) 1 power JST connection (3 pins: 1 5V and 2 GND) Pin details Assembly To assemble the board, you'll need - 30 pins Female Dupont Connectors, 2.54mm pitch (2x 15-pin). This is for holding the ESP-32 - 15 x 3 pins Male Dupont Connectors, 2.54mm pitch, for connecting potentiomers, servos) - 2 x 2 pin Male Dupont for push buttons and 5 pin Male Dupont for Joystick - 1 ESP32 It's all just through-hole soldering, so it goes pretty quick once you have the parts. Use the CAD renders as a guide. You will also probably want to create a 2-pin 5V USB cable like this one: It's just power, and ground, and goes into the 5V/GND JST connector next to the ESP32. You'll also need to bodge that 5V in pin to the Vin pin that goes to the ESP32","title":"ClearGauntlet-PCB-rev B"},{"location":"mainPCB-revB/#cleargauntlet-pcb-rev-b","text":"PCB - Schematics Design for VR Gloves A breakout board for ClearGauntlets, aimed at improving cable management and minifying electronics of VR Gloves.","title":"ClearGauntlet-PCB-rev B"},{"location":"mainPCB-revB/#specs","text":"The board has the following I/O: 1 ESP 32 V1 10 potentiometers, each requires 1 3.3V pin, 1 GND, 1 Analog pin. 5 servo motors, each requires 1 5V pin, 1 GND, 1 Analog pin. 2 pushed bottons 1 joystick (5 pins) 1 power JST connection (3 pins: 1 5V and 2 GND)","title":"Specs"},{"location":"mainPCB-revB/#pin-details","text":"","title":"Pin details"},{"location":"mainPCB-revB/#assembly","text":"To assemble the board, you'll need - 30 pins Female Dupont Connectors, 2.54mm pitch (2x 15-pin).
