# ClearGauntlet - Power System
Power System is used to supply power to the microcontroller (ESP32) and all servos that are required 5V supplies.

## Motivation: 
Our ideal power system is to at least provide 5-6 hours of normal play, plus it can be recharged during play or be quickly swapped. 
Other ergonomics factors include light weight, modular, and can be secured during gameplay. We want our system to be flexible as well, meaning the part is readily available and has easy alternative.

To that we, we choose an off-the-shef battery module and 18650 battery. We also design a case for the module.

## Spec:
Some estimated specification for our system
    -   Battery Capacity
    -   Voltage Max / Current Supply max
    -   Charging spped
