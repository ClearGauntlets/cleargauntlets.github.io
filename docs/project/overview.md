# Projects

ClearGauntlets is composed of a handful of projects designed to produce a premium, DIY-friendly pair of haptic feedback gloves. The project is essentially a glorified fork of the LucidVR project, and tries to maintain as much upstream compatibility as possible, with any deviations well-documented.

## [PCB](https://github.com/ClearGauntlets/ClearGauntlet-PCB)
A compact PCB designed to break out all the IO you'll need in an extremely tight package.

## [Firmware](https://github.com/ClearGauntlets/lucidgloves/tree/main/firmware/lucidgloves-firmware)
A fork of the [LucidGloves](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves) project that we base our firmware off of.

## [UI](https://github.com/ClearGauntlets/opengloves-ui)
A fork of LucidVR's UI system.

## [Driver](https://github.com/ClearGauntlets/opengloves-driver)
Our Fork of the LucidVR Steam Windows Drivers

## [Tracker](https://github.com/ClearGauntlets/vive-diy-position-sensor)
A custom implementation of a Lighthouse V1 tracker. This is an extremely cheap way to enable tracking for your project.
