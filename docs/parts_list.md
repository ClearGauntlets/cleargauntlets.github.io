There's a million of these guys on Amazon and friends, and they're usually around $5-10 a pop. Fantastic microcontroller, and is the heart and soul of this project. Specifically, you need one with this pinout:

### [ClearGauntlet PCB](https://github.com/ClearGauntlets/ClearGauntlet-PCB/)

This PCB is still in active development, so I'd hold off on ordering unless you intend to help us work on it. If you're local to Rochester, NY, I have a few Rev B spares I could lend you!

### [DIYMore 18650 Battery Holder](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SZKNST4/ref=twister_B07SZL2MMD?_encoding=UTF8&th=1)

This is how we're providing power to our system right now. It's a cheap, reliable-ish system that is rated for 5V/3A output, as well as 3.3V/1A output, has multiple solder points for dupont connectors, or whatever, as well as a USB-A port. It can charge over USB-C, or over Micro USB. This guy sits in a 3D-printed case strapped to the arm, and then crimped wires go out the front to the glove. I've found the board to be pretty fragile, though, so watch out for that.

... and much, MUCH more!
