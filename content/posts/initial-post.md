Welcome to the ClearGauntlets website!

This website is the home of the ClearGauntlets project, a fork of the LucidVR project focusing on refining the "reel" design of Prototype 4.1 to create a sleeker, more effective virtual reality glove. The main gimmick of this project is "premium" design. The price ceiling per pair is raised from $60 to $200, but for that, we hope to give you simpler, smaller, more reliable reels, a better PCB and wiring harness, and SteamVR tracking!

Please bear with us as we build all this, it's really complicated.

This website also hopes to become a resource for anyone looking to get into VR hacking, a starting place for learning the basic components of a VR system, a host for detailed descriptions, source code, schematics, and guides. Ideally, you will be able to go from zero to full pair of custom gloves just by clicking through this website.

Welcome. I really hope this will work.
