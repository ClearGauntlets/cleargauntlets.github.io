This website is the home of the ClearGauntlets project, a fork of the LucidVR project focusing on refining the \"reel\" design of Prototype 4.1 to create a sleeker, more effective virtual reality glove. The main gimmick of this project is \"premium\" design. The price ceiling per pair is raised from $60 to $200, but for that, we hope to give you simpler, smaller, more reliable reels, a better PCB and wiring harness, and SteamVR tracking! Please bear with us as we build all this, it's really complicated. This website also hopes to become a resource for anyone looking to get into VR hacking, a starting place for learning the basic components of a VR system, a host for detailed descriptions, source code, schematics, and guides. Ideally, you will be able to go from zero to full pair of custom gloves just by clicking through this website.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome-to-clearwiki","text":"This website is the home of the ClearGauntlets project, a fork of the LucidVR project focusing on refining the \"reel\" design of Prototype 4.1 to create a sleeker, more effective virtual reality glove.

The project is essentially a glorified fork of the LucidVR project, and tries to maintain as much upstream compatibility as possible, with any deviations well-documented. PCB A compact PCB designed to break out all the IO you'll need in an extremely tight package. Firmware A fork of the LucidGloves project that we base our firmware off of. UI A fork of LucidVR's UI system. Driver Our Fork of the LucidVR Steam Windows Drivers Tracker A custom implementation of a Lighthouse V1 tracker. This is an extremely cheap way to enable tracking for your project.","title":"Projects"},{"location":"projects/#projects","text":"ClearGauntlets is composed of a handful of projects designed to produce a premium, DIY-friendly pair of haptic feedback gloves.
