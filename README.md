## Developing

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for site generation

1. Clone this repo
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv ./venv`
3. Enter the virtual environment: `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install dependencies: `python -m pip install -r .\requirements.txt`
5. Run a dev instance: `mkdocs serve`. Each time you change something and save the file, the server will automatically re-build the page.
6. When you're finished, push to a new branch and open a PR.
7. To leave the virtual environment, type `deactivate` or just close the terminal.
